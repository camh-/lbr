config LBR_CONFIG_FRAGMENTS
	string "Fragments to add to this config"
	help
	  Fragments to combine to create the defconfig.

	  The defconfig for the build can be build from fragments so you
	  do not need to specify the same configuration for multiple
	  layers. Each fragment is applied in order with this config
	  being applied last. The latest value for a setting overrides
	  any previous values.

	  When the defconfig for this layer is saved, the fragments are
	  removed so as to leave a minimal defconfig that contains only
	  the configuration items specific to this layer.

	  Config fragments are found by searching in the board's config
	  directory, the config directory of each element in the parent
	  chain for the board, the project's config directory and the
	  core config directory, in that order.

config LBR_BUILD_OVERLAY
       bool "Build an overlay-only image"
       default n
       help
         Build an image to use as an overlay for another build.

         Buildroot supports customizing the target root filesystem
         with overlays, which are parallel directory trees overlaid
         over the root filesystem that buildroot builds.

         If you select yes here, buildroot will build such an image
         overlay without the skeleton parts of the image so that it
         can be overlayed over a standard buildroot rootfs image.

	 This option is only applied if the LBR_CORE post-build script
	 is executed, by adding $(BR2_EXTERNAL_LBR_CORE_PATH)/post-build.sh
	 to BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT.

config LBR_OVERLAY_IMAGES
	string "Layer image overlays to add to this layer"
	help
	  Overlay images to incorporate into this build.

	  Image names should be specified as <layer> or <board>/<layer>.
	  Image names without a <board> refer to the current board.

config LBR_BUILD_BOARD_IMAGE
	bool "Build ultimate board image"
	default n
	help
	  Build the ultimate image for the board.

	  This is done by invoking the build-image.sh script in the
	  board directory. The current working directory will be the
	  board image directory when build-image.sh is invoked (not
	  the layer image directory).
