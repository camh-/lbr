config BR2_BUILD_OVERLAY
       bool "Build an overlay-only image"
       default n
       help
         Build an image to use as an overlay for another build.

         Buildroot supports customizing the target root filesystem
         with overlays, which are parallel directory trees overlaid
         over the root filesystem that buildroot builds.

         If you select yes here, buildroot will build such an image
         overlay without the skeleton parts of the image so that it
         can be overlayed over a standard buildroot rootfs image.

	 This option is only applied if the BRP_CORE post-build script
	 is executed, by adding $(BR2_EXTERNAL_BRP_CORE_PATH)/post-build.sh
	 to BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT.
